# CapitalOne-TestMailing-to-RollOutMailing
Capital One Credit Card Design: Predictive modeling to maximize profits from solicitation 92-1 by planning and implementing mailings of up to 12  different product offers to up to 750,000 prospects. 

There are 750,000 people in a database; 250,000 in each of three BK groups (150, 200, and 250). You can 
send, at most, one solicitation (product) to each prospect. Each solicitation can offer one, and only one, 
of the 12 available products, but you can send different solicitations to different prospects. 
 
You can send your solicitations in two separate mailings (test and roll out). Or you can choose to forego a 
test and simply send out a single roll-out mailing. See the case on Study.Net for more information about 
the cost of developing and mailing a solicitation. 
 
Note: You only get one shot at this! You can send out only one test mailing and one 
roll-out mailing. It is not possible to reset the exercise, even if you make a mistake 
in either mailing, so please be careful!  
 
Once you log in you will find a link on the landing page to a pdf “Scenario and User Guide,” that provides 
screenshots and a user-guide.  
 
Preparation questions: 
1.  Why does Customer Lifetime Value vary with BK score? Why does Customer Lifetime Value vary by 
product? (See Exhibit 2 to help answer these questions)
2.  Are predictive models estimated on historical data useful in this case? If so, why? If not, why not? 
3.  Is there a “best product” that will likely be preferred by all customers? If so, what is it? 
4.  Describe and justify your testing strategy

We will use results from the interactive web simulation to assess your testing strategy. 10 points will be 
based on the total profit generated in the exercise (i.e., round 1 + round2) and 20 points will be based on 
the quality of your analysis and your supporting arguments in the write-up. A final 10 points will be 
assigned based on the quality of your group presentation.
